**__Web Development Challenges__**

**Challenge I**
Create a new, completely empty Git repository. Then, create a README.md file in Visual Studio Code and upload that to your main branch of your newly created Git repository.

**Challenge II**
Create an About Me site page. The page should have 3 parts:
1. A paragraph about you.
2. A list of hobbies or favorite things.
3. An image of your choosing.
After each part, you should upload your progress to your GitHub repo on a working branch. After all parts have been completed, merge your working branch to your main branch.

**Challenge III**
Style your About Me page using CSS. Your styling should demonstrate your understanding of the Box Model. You should use a flexbox on your list of hobbies or favorite things to list them horizontally instead of vertically. Upload your changes to GitHub and merge to your main branch.

**Challenge IV**
Create a function that will add an item to a list that is kept between function calls; so each function call will increase the size of the list. Upload your changes to your GitHub working branch.

**Challenge V**
Create a function that will print the list of items in an alert. Upload your changes to your GitHub working branch.

**Challenge VI**
Create a button that, when clicked, will run the function you created in Challenge V. Upload your changes to your GitHub working branch.

**Challenge VII**
Create a second button and input box that will add the text supplied in the input box into the function created in Challenge IV when the button is clicked. Upload your changes to your GitHub working branch, then merge your changes to your main branch.

**Elite Challenge I**
Instead of displaying the list of items in an alert, display them in a custom toast message. A toast is similar to an alert, but it doesn't take control of the screen, can be dismissed, and if not dismissed after a certain period of time, will dismiss itself. Upload your changes to your GitHub working branch, and then merge your changes to your main branch.

**Elite Challenge II**
Create a shopping cart app. This shopping cart should have the following functionality:
1. Be able to add an item to the cart.
2. Be able to remove an item from the cart.
3. Be able to check off an item in the cart.
Upload your app to a GitHub repository. Use proper branching procedures while working on the app.
