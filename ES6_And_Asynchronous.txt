__**Advanced JavaScript**__

**Challenge I**
Create an HTML page with a header and a button. The header should say "Waiting" and the button should say "Click Me!". When the button is clicked, change the text of the header to "Working, Please Wait", then change it back after 5 seconds.

**Challenge II**
Create an HTML page with a button. The button should call a function that uses the Fetch API to connect to the PokeAPI and display the result in an alert as a string.

**Challenge III**
Fetch the pokemon Nidoking and display its name in a header and its hp in a paragraph.

**Challenge IV**
Use async and await to simplify the syntax of your Fetch API function.

**Challenge V**
Add an text box input element to your page. Instead of retrieving Nidoking, you should now retrieve whichever Pokemon that is input in the input box.

**Elite Challenge I**
Ensure that the function using the Fetch API takes in 1 parameter: the name of the Pokemon that is to be searched. Create a decorator that accepts a string and a function and calls the function, passing the string to it as an argument. This string should first be converted to one that the PokeAPI can understand.
