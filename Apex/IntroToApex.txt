__**Intro To Apex**__

**Challenge I**
Create a class called Calculator with a single method called Add. This method should take 2 Integer parameters and return their sum.

**Challenge II**
Create a method called Multiply that takes 2 Integer parameters and returns their product. You are not allowed to use the * operator to multiply the two Integers, and you must use your Add method you created in Challenge I.

**Challenge III**
Create a method called Divide that takes 2 Integer parameters and returns their quotient (Parameter 1 / Parameter 2). Once again, you are not allowed to use the / operator, and you must use your Add method. For this challenge, do not consider if zero is the divisor.

**Challenge IV**
Modify your Divide method so that it will return 0 if zero is the divisor.

**Challenge V**
Create a method called Mod that takes 2 Integer parameters and returns their remainder. You are not allowed to use the Math.Mod() method.

**Elite Challenge I**
Create a method called Calculate that takes in a String in proper mathematical format (eg. 1 + 1) and returns the result.
